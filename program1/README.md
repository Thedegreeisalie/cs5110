- [X] a)	Change the name of the game  (which displays at the beginning) to be something other than “wormy”
- [X] b)	Change the colors that display at the beginning.  For example:
- [X] c)	Use a “larger” grid.
- [X] d)	Have multiple apples on the grid.  New apples will be generated as they are eaten.  
- [X] e)	Allow the user(s) to control two snakes using the arrow keys (for one snake) and four other keys (for the other snake)
- [X] f)	The keypad arrow keys will be used to move both worms in the same direction at the same time.  The keypad arrow key names are K_KP2, K_KP4,  K_KP6, and K_KP8.
- [X] g)	Show the scores for both snakes.   You can use whatever scoring system you like. 
- [X] h)	The snake dies when it hits a wall, the other snake, or itself.  
- [X] i)	Implement some variation of this idea: Allow the snakes to shoot each other.  If the snake is hit, it cuts him in pieces (based on where the ray hits him).  The tail is left behind as a stone.  If a stone is hit by either snake, the snake dies.
